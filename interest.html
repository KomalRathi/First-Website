			<h1> Interest in Computer Science </h1>
			<p> 
			I would like to study Computer Science as I believe it is becoming more useful as the world becomes more technology-based. My interest in this topic began when I started a HTML project in Year 8. I think that it is fascinating that the internet is available at the click of a button and within a split second, you are taken to a site or page of your choice. I also like the fact that this degree is logical and predominantly maths-based. I am excited by the multidisciplinary applications available such as in medicine, where algorithms for protein folding and synthesis are used, as well as in finance. </p>
			<p> I think that there are endless possibilities of using code and that one line of code can be turned into something fascinating and most likely essential. For example, the Google site looks simplistic yet is so complex and is something that one utilises almost daily while taking it for granted. This is why I would love to study Computer Science due to the potentially huge impact for people across the world.
