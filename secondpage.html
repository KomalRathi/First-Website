			<h1> Reasons for choosing these subjects to study at A-Level </h1>
			<p> 
			I decided to study Maths and Further Maths because I enjoy 	logical problem solving. For example, I have been participating in UKMT maths challenges since Year 7 and most recently, I achieved a Gold in the Intermediate Maths Challenge, scoring the best in my year as well as qualifying for the next round (Pink Kangaroo). 
			</p>
			<p>
			I have chosen to study Chemistry because I am particularly interested in organic chemistry and would like to study this in more depth. My first taste of organic chemistry was in Year 9, when I was chosen to participate in the Salters' Chemistry Challenge. I was fascinated both by the molymod of the complex structure of paracetamol, and also the synthesis practical. My favourite part of Chemistry is the problem-solving aspect, such as when applying the cation and anion tests to determine the structure of an unknown substance.
			</p>
			<p> 
			I am studying A Level Biology as I am intrigued by the human body. I particularly enjoyed the dissection practicals completed at GCSE level such as the dissection of the kidney and heart to find out more about their internal structure. I particularly enjoyed participating in the Biology Challenge (where I achieved a Gold) because I enjoyed looking beyond the syllabus and learning general biology knowledge.
