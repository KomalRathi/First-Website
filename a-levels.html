			<h1> A-Level Choices </h1>
			<br>
			<h2> Maths </h2>
			<p> 
			I decided to study Maths and Further Maths because I enjoy logical problem solving. Furthermore, I feel as though the skills which I learn in Maths are easily transferrable to my other subjects. For example, I have been participating in UKMT maths challenges since Year 7 which allow me to practice my problem solving skills. </p>
			<p>As Galileo Galilei once said, mathematics is the language with which God has written the universe.</p>

			<h2> Chemistry </h2>
			<p>
			I have chosen to study Chemistry because I am particularly interested in organic chemistry and would like to study this in more depth. My first taste of organic chemistry was in Year 9, when I was chosen to participate in the Salters' Chemistry Challenge. I was fascinated both by the molymod of the complex structure of paracetamol, and also the synthesis practical. My favourite part of Chemistry is the problem-solving aspect, such as when applying the cation and anion tests to determine the structure of an unknown substance.

			<h2> Biology </h2>
			<p> 
			I am studying A Level Biology as I am intrigued by the human body. I particularly enjoyed the dissection practicals completed at GCSE level such as the dissection of the kidney and heart to find out more about their internal structure.
