<p> Hello. My name is Komal Rathi and I am currently a student at Nottingham High School. I am studying Maths, Further Maths, Chemistry and Biology for my A-Levels and am planning to study Computer Science at university. </p>

<section>
<h4> Reasons for choosing these subjects </h4>
<p> I have chosen to study Maths and Further Maths because I enjoy logical problem solving. For example, I have been participating in UKMT maths challenges since Year 7 and most recently, I achieved a Gold in the Intermediate Maths Challenge, scoring the best in my year as well as qualifying for the next round (Pink Kangaroo). 
<br>
I chose to study Chemistry because I am particularly interested in organic chemistry and would like to study this in more depth. My first taste of organic chemistry was in Year 9, when I was chosen to participate in the Saltersâ€™ Chemistry Challenge. I was fascinated both by the molymod of the complex structure of paracetamol, and also the synthesis practical. 
My favourite part of Chemistry is the problem-solving aspect, such as when applying the cation and anion tests to determine the structure of an unknown substance.
<br>
I am studying A Level Biology as I am intrigued by the human body. I particularly enjoyed the dissection practicals completed at GCSE level such as the dissection of the kidney and heart to find out more about their internal structure. I particularly enjoyed participating in the Biology Challenge (where I achieved a Gold) because I enjoyed looking beyond the syllabus and learning general biology knowledge. </p>

<h4> My Interest in Computer Science </h4>
<p> I would like to study Computer Science as I believe it is becoming more useful as the world becomes more technology-based. My interest in this topic began when I started a HTML project in Year 8. I think that it is fascinating that the internet is available at the click of a button and within a split second, you are taken to a site or page of your choice. I also like the fact that this degree is predominantly maths-based and is logical. I am excited by the multidisciplinary applications for example in medicine ,such as algorithms for protein folding and synthesis, as well as in finance. I think that there are endless possibilities of using code and that one line of code can be turned into something beautiful. For example, the Google site looks simplistic yet is so complex and holds almost all the answers you require. Finally, I would love to study Computer Science because of the potentially huge impact for people across the world. </p>

<h5> My Hobbies </h5>
<p> In my free time, I enjoy participating in sports such as swimming and rounders. I also enjoy watching documentaries such as Air Crash Investigation on National Geographic.   </p>
