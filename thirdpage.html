			<h3> My Interest in Computer Science </h3>
			<p> 
			I would like to study Computer Science as I believe it is becoming more useful as the world becomes more technology-based. My interest in this topic began when I started a HTML project in Year 8. I think that it is fascinating that the internet is available at the click of a button and within a split second, you are taken to a site or page of your choice. I also like the fact that this degree is predominantly maths-based and is logical. I am excited by the multidisciplinary applications for example in medicine, such as algorithms for protein folding and synthesis, as well as in finance. I think that there are endless possibilities of using code and that one line of code can be turned into something beautiful. For example, the Google site looks simplistic yet is so complex and holds almost all the answers you require. Finally, I would love to study Computer Science because of the potentially huge impact for people across the world.
